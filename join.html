      <h1>So You Want to Join?</h1>
      You can start by joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/CqZaCbP"></a> server. Someone's bound to be online, and if you're interested, we'll make you a member ASAP, and you can get coding right away.
      <h1>Once You're a Member...</h1>
      You can start by trying out some of the coding challenges on our Discord server. If you run into any difficulty, we'll help you in the form of hints or advice. Additionally, we are planning to have a member page on the website, and, so this can happen, we'll need a picture of you (preferably just you, and just your face) to put on the website. We'll also want a bio of just 1-2 sentences to caption this image with.

    <div class="container" id="container-right">
      <h1>Languages</h1>
      Though we currently only use JavaScript and Python, C++ and Java are accepted for CodeWars as well. If there's enough support for a different programming language, we're all for it, and we'll start making a CodeWare equivalent in that language. Those who want to code in a different language will be organized into their own team or teams.
      <h1>Other Info</h1>
      We meet Wednesday after school until 4:00 in room 506, Mr. Imrie's computer lab. You don't need a computer or a flash drive (though feel free to bring either), but you should upload all of your files to Discord, and then you can access them from the school's computers.
