      <h1>Our Goal</h1>
      Part of our goal is to train ourselves to be competitive in CodeWars. Part of our goal is to teach ourselves not only how to code, but, perhaps even more importantly, how to collaborate while doing so. Part of our goal is to accomplish more than we could alone. And, most importantly, part of our goal is to have your help. Having experience with coding and thinking logically are bonuses, of course, but anyone can be a coder, and we're willing to help you no matter what. We'll present programming challenges a few days before our meetings, and we'll help anyone having difficulty to make sure we're all on the same page. Our only requirements are an open mind and some motivation.
      <h1>What is CodeWars?</h1>
      <a href="http://hpcodewars.org">HP CodeWars</a> is an annual coding competition (taking place in early March) for high school students of any grade held in various sites across the world. It's renowned for leading to internships and having a format that is relevant to the type of programming you would see assigned in a career. Presenting a wide variety problems with a difficulty curve that separates the intelligent from the outstanding, performing well in this competition, aside from the other benefits, can be put on resumes. For this reason, and many others, anyone considering a career in computer science would be perfect for this club.

      <h1>CodeWare</h1>
      CodeWare is a huge project that we'll all be collaborating on throughout the months before the competition. CodeWars allows its teams to bring in their own code to help them, so we'll be making CodeWare - what will eventually be a powerful program to help us become the best competitors possible. This will also form skills in collaboritive coding, a surprisingly important skill at any level of programming, and especially relevant to a competing team. CodeWare will make the competition's problems easier by letting us focus on tackling the hardest parts of a difficult challenge first, rather than repeatedly building the same foundation from the ground up and wasting precious time.
